# OpenStack_Summit_2018_Vancouver
Containerize your life!

In this lab I will show a practical way to use heavy software (like
OpenStack) or annoying software (like Cisco AnyConnect) via container
technologies on insufficient or precious resources - for testing and
preparing customer environments - or just because we can :-)

We will start with preparing our laptops and then creating a sufficient
CentOS image to put some workloads on it like an IPA and RDO-Packstack or
RHOSP-Director with 5 nodes to see possibilities and limits of this
approach.

Attention! This lab is not for deploying production environments - it's
more about embedding software that's normally running in VMs on your weak
Linux Laptop for testing things out. As an example we use OpenStack - if
you know how this one works, everything else is a breeze!
